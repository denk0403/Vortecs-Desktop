Vortecs is a free, offline, and simple education tool for displaying 2D vectors and visualizing 2D linear transformations. It is designed to be used primarily by students who are being introduced to Linear Algebra concepts for the first time.

# Features!
  - [x] Make and display 2D vectors on a coordinate plane
  - [x] Quickly negate, rotate, shear, and normalize individual vectors
  - [x] Easily zoom, pan, and re-center the **infinite** and **scalable** coordinate plane
  - [x] Right-click to apply and commit multiple 2D linear transformations on vectors
    - Select from a list of common transformations or apply a custom transformation
  - [x] Adjust the animation speed
  - [x] Right-click during animations to pause, play, or stop the animation
